The FAO Statistics Team (NFISS) of Fisheries and Aquaculture Division collates world capture and aquaculture production statistics at either the species, genus, family or higher taxonomic levels in 3 175 statistical categories (2022 data release) referred to as species items.

ASFIS list of species includes 13 420 species items selected according to their interest or relation to fisheries and aquaculture. 
For each species item stored in a record, codes (ISSCAAP group, taxonomic and 3-alpha) and taxonomic information (scientific name, author(s), family, and higher taxonomic classification) are provided. 
An English name is available for most of the records, and about one third of them have also a French and Spanish name. 
Information is also provided about the availability of fishery production statistics on the species item in the FAO databases.
